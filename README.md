I am a recovering academic, smoothly interpolating from protein design to computational chemistry with structural biology in between. In a past life, I also dabbled in systems biology (reaction-diffusion models of human respiration) but have scaled down to molecules since then.

- Techniques I use most frequently: Bayesian inference, Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo, Protein Language Models. 

- Stuff I've developed:
  - [integrative epitope mapping of nanobodies on pathogenic targets](https://github.com/integrativemodeling/nbspike)
  - [integrative structure of the yeast Smc5/6 complex](https://github.com/integrativemodeling/smc56_nse256)
  - [manybody potential for coarse grained MD simulations](https://docs.lammps.org/pair_local_density.html)
  - [Bayesian network based integration of cell models](https://github.com/tanmoy7989/bayesian_metamodeling_tutorial)
  
- Stuff I'm working on right now:
  - design of bispecific nanobody chimeras
  - stochastic partitioning of protein complexes into multi-chain domains.
