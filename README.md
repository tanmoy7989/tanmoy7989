Hi,

- I am a computational structural biologist and I build *integrative* models of macromolecular protein complexes from experimental data that is...surprise..surprise..hard to integrate. 

- Techniques I use most frequently: Bayesian inference, Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo, rigid-body kinematics

- Other techniques I use: deep learning, molecular dynamics.

- Stuff I've developed: 
  - [manybody potential for coarse grained MD simulations](https://docs.lammps.org/pair_local_density.html)
  - [Bayesian network based integration of cell models](https://github.com/tanmoy7989/bayesian_metamodeling_tutorial)
  - [integrative structure of the yeast Smc5/6 complex](https://github.com/integrativemodeling/smc56_nse256)

- Stuff I'm working on now: 
  - Stochastic partitioning of protein complexes
  - pairwise competition based spatial restraints for docking in-silico antibody cocktail.

Feel free to reach out if you want to know more about my research and/or wish to collaborate (I'm usually pretty active on twitter!).
